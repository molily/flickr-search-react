# Tasks for learning React

1. Counter component with + and - buttons with a state: `count`
2. Same counter with a reset button
3. Same counter with prop: `initialCount`
4. A counter without state, only props: `count: Number`, `onIncrease: Function`, `onDecrease: Function`, `reset: Function`. The state for all counters is saved in the parent component (`App`).
