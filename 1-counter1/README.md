# Counter 1

Implement a reusable Counter component with + (increase) and - (decrease) buttons with a state: `count`.

## Steps

1. Create a new Counter.js file.
2. Declare and export a new class extending Reactâ€™s Component class.
3. Import and instantiate the Counter in App.
4. Implement a constructor that initializes the state `count` with a number (e.g. `0`).
5. Implement a render method that renders an increase button, the current count and a decrease button.
6. Add click handlers to the buttons that call methods of the class.
7. In these methods, use `setState` to increase / decrease the `count`.
